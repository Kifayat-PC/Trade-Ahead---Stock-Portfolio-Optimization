# 📈 Trade&Ahead: Portfolio Optimization via Unsupervised Learning  
## 💡 Clustering Financial Assets for Smarter Investment Strategies

Trade&Ahead is a data science project designed to optimize investment portfolio construction by leveraging unsupervised machine learning. Faced with the challenge of analyzing hundreds of stocks across diverse financial metrics, this project uses clustering algorithms to segment stocks into distinct investment profiles—helping financial consultants and investors make data-driven, risk-aware decisions.

Using real-world stock market data, I applied K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group companies based on financial similarity, followed by PCA-based visualization to uncover structure within high-dimensional data. The resulting clusters revealed actionable insights, such as identifying undervalued stocks, stable dividend payers, and high-growth opportunities.

I also performed cluster profiling to interpret each group’s financial behavior, aligning them with strategic investment approaches. Evaluation methods like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Cophenetic Correlation ensured high-quality clustering..

## 📈 Results & Insights

Stocks were grouped into **5 distinct clusters** based on financial similarity.

Each cluster mapped to different investment profiles:

- ✅ **Stable dividend stocks**
- 📈 **High-growth, high-volatility stocks**
- 💰 **Undervalued assets** (low P/E and high earnings)

👉 Investors can select stocks from different clusters to **maximize diversification** and **minimize portfolio risk**.
